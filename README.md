# GooseRelayVPN

**[🇮🇷 راهنمای فارسی (Persian)](README_FA.md)**

A SOCKS5 VPN that tunnels **raw TCP** through a Google Apps Script web app to your own small VPS exit server. To anything on the network path your client only ever talks TLS to a Google IP with `SNI=www.google.com`. Everything in flight is AES-256-GCM encrypted end-to-end — Google never sees plaintext and never holds the key.

> **How it works in simple terms:** Your browser/app talks SOCKS5 to this tool on your computer. The tool wraps every TCP byte in AES-GCM frames and posts them through a Google-facing HTTPS connection to a free Apps Script web app you control. The Apps Script forwards those bytes verbatim to your own VPS, which decrypts and opens the real connection. To the firewall/filter it looks like you're just talking to Google.

> ⚠️ **You need a small VPS for the exit server.** Unlike pure-Apps-Script proxies, this project tunnels raw TCP — anything SOCKS5 can carry — so a real `net.Dial` has to happen somewhere. A small $4/month VPS is plenty. In exchange you can tunnel SSH, IMAP, custom protocols, anything — not just HTTP.

## Important Notes

- Never share `tunnel_key` with anyone. Anyone with this key can use your tunnel/VPS as if they are you.
- A server with public internet access is required. Your exit server must be reachable from Google Apps Script.
- Each Google Apps Script deployment ID has a quota of about 20,000 executions per day, and the quota resets around 10:30 AM Iran time (GMT+3:30).
- You do not need to install a local MITM certificate in this project. The certificate setup in `MasterHttpRelayVPN` is for that project's architecture and is not required here.
- This project was inspired by the idea in the main repository: https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN

## How It Works

```
Browser/App
  -> SOCKS5  (127.0.0.1:1080)
  -> AES-256-GCM raw-TCP frames
  -> HTTPS to a Google edge IP   (SNI=www.google.com, Host=script.google.com)
  -> Apps Script doPost()        (dumb forwarder, never sees plaintext)
  -> Your VPS :8443/tunnel       (decrypts, demuxes by session_id, dials target)
  <- Same path in reverse via long-polling
```

Your application sends TCP bytes through the SOCKS5 listener on your computer. The client encrypts each chunk with AES-256-GCM and POSTs batches over a domain-fronted HTTPS connection to your Apps Script web app. The Apps Script is a ~30-line script that forwards the body verbatim to your VPS — it never decrypts and the AES key never touches Google. Your VPS decrypts, dials the real target, and pumps bytes back along the same path. The filter sees only TLS to Google.

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get an outside-Iran VPS

You need a Linux VPS with a public IP. Any provider works.

### Step 2: Get the binaries

**Option A — Download a pre-built release (recommended):**

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/kianmhz/GooseRelayVPN/releases).
2. Download the right archive for your OS:
   - Windows: `GooseRelayVPN-client-vX.Y.Z-windows-amd64.zip`
   - macOS (Intel): `GooseRelayVPN-client-vX.Y.Z-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`
   - macOS (M1/M2/M3): `GooseRelayVPN-client-vX.Y.Z-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
   - Linux: `GooseRelayVPN-client-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
3. Extract it. You'll find `goose-client` and an example config inside.

**Option B — Build from source (Go 1.22+):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kianmhz/GooseRelayVPN.git
cd GooseRelayVPN
go build -o goose-client ./cmd/client
go build -o goose-server ./cmd/server
```

### Step 3: Generate a secret key

Run this once:

```bash
bash scripts/gen-key.sh
```

Copy the 64-character string it prints. You'll use the **same value** in both the client and server configs. Keep it secret — anyone with this key can use your tunnel.

### Step 4: Configure

Copy the example configs:

```bash
cp client_config.example.json client_config.json
cp server_config.example.json server_config.json
```

Open both files and paste your key into the `tunnel_key` field. Leave `script_keys` empty for now.

`client_config.json`:

```json
{
  "socks_host":  "127.0.0.1",
  "socks_port":  1080,
  "google_host": "216.239.38.120",
  "sni":         "www.google.com",
  "script_keys": ["PASTE_DEPLOYMENT_ID"],
  "tunnel_key":  "PASTE_OUTPUT_OF_GEN_KEY"
}
```

`server_config.json`:

```json
{
  "server_host": "0.0.0.0",
  "server_port": 8443,
  "tunnel_key":  "SAME_VALUE_AS_CLIENT"
}
```

### Step 5: Set up the Google Apps Script

This is the free Google-side piece that hides your traffic.

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and sign in.
2. Click **New project**.
3. Delete the default code and paste everything from [`apps_script/Code.gs`](apps_script/Code.gs).
4. Change this line to your VPS IP:
   ```javascript
    const VPS_URL = 'http://YOUR.VPS.IP:8443/tunnel';
   ```
5. Click **Deploy → New deployment** → set type to **Web app**.
6. Set **Execute as:** Me and **Who has access:** Anyone.
7. Click **Deploy** and copy the Deployment ID from the URL (the long string between `/s/` and `/exec`).
8. Paste that ID into `script_keys` in `client_config.json`.

> ⚠️ Every time you edit `Code.gs` you must create a **new deployment** and update `script_keys`.

### Step 6:  Keep the server running after reboot (systemd)

If you want the exit server to start automatically after a VPS reboot, create a systemd service.

Run:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/goose-relay.service
```

Paste this (replace paths if your binary/config are elsewhere):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=GooseRelayVPN exit server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/root
ExecStart=/root/goose-server-linux -config /root/server_config.json
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable goose-relay
sudo systemctl start goose-relay
sudo systemctl status goose-relay --no-pager
```

### Step 7: Run the client

```bash
./goose-client -config client_config.json
```

You should see:

```
[client] SOCKS5 listening on 127.0.0.1:1080
```

This should print your **VPS IP**, not your own.

Now set your browser to use SOCKS5 proxy `127.0.0.1:1080`:

- **Firefox:** Settings → Network Settings → Manual proxy → SOCKS5 host `127.0.0.1` port `1080`. Check **Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5**.
- **Chrome/Edge:** Use an extension like FoxyProxy or SwitchyOmega.
- **System-wide on macOS/Linux:** Set SOCKS5 in network settings.

---

## LAN Sharing (Optional)

By default the client listens on `127.0.0.1:1080` so only your computer can use it. To share with other devices on your local network, set `socks_host` to `0.0.0.0` in `client_config.json` and restart.

> ⚠️ **Security note:** Anyone on your LAN can then proxy through your tunnel and consume your Apps Script quota. Only do this on trusted networks.

---

## Increase capacity with multiple deployments (recommended)

Each Google account's Apps Script deployment is rate-limited to **~20,000 calls/day**. The client polls about once per second when idle, so a single deployment can sustain steady use, but heavy days hit the cap. To go beyond that, deploy `Code.gs` multiple times — under the same Google account or a few different ones — and put all the Deployment IDs into `script_keys`:

```json
{
  "script_keys": [
    "FIRST_DEPLOYMENT_ID",
    "SECOND_DEPLOYMENT_ID",
    "THIRD_DEPLOYMENT_ID"
  ]
}
```

What the client does for you automatically:

- **Round-robin** across all configured deployments.
- **Health-aware blacklist** — if one starts failing, the client backs off from it (3 s, 6 s, 12 s, … up to ~48 s) and keeps using the others.
- **Same-poll failover** — if a poll fails on one deployment, the same payload is retried on another within the same poll cycle, so no traffic is lost during transient quota or 5xx events.

> 💡 All deployments must use **the same `tunnel_key`** because they all forward to the same VPS, which only has one AES key. You don't need to change anything on the VPS when you add more deployments.

> 💡 You can paste either just the Deployment ID (the part between `/s/` and `/exec`) or the full `/exec` URL — the client extracts the ID either way.

## Configuration

### Client (`client_config.json`)

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `socks_host` | `127.0.0.1` | Host/IP for the local SOCKS5 listener. Set to `0.0.0.0` for LAN sharing. |
| `socks_port` | `1080` | Port for the local SOCKS5 listener. |
| `google_host` | `216.239.38.120` | Google edge IP/host to dial (port is fixed to `443`). |
| `sni` | `www.google.com` | SNI presented during TLS handshake. |
| `script_keys` | — | Array of Apps Script Deployment IDs (no full URL needed). One ID is required; add more for health-aware load balancing and to spread quota across multiple deployments. |
| `tunnel_key` | — | 64-char hex AES-256 key. Must match the server byte-for-byte. |

### Server (`server_config.json`)

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `server_host` | `0.0.0.0` | Host/IP where the exit server binds. |
| `server_port` | `8443` | Port where the exit server listens. Must be reachable from Google's network. |
| `tunnel_key` | — | 64-char hex AES-256 key. Must match the client. |

## Updating the Apps Script forwarder

If you change `Code.gs` - for example to point at a new droplet IP - you must create a **new deployment** in the Apps Script editor (Deploy -> **New deployment**, not just "Manage deployments"). Saving alone does nothing; the live `/exec` URL serves the published version. After redeploying, update `script_keys` in `client_config.json`.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────┐
│ Browser │──►│ goose-client │──►│ Google edge  │──►│ Apps Script │──►│  Your    │──► Internet
│  / App  │◄──│  (SOCKS5)    │◄──│ TLS, fronted │◄──│  doPost()   │◄──│  VPS     │◄──
└─────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └──────────┘
              AES-256-GCM         SNI=www.google     dumb forwarder    decrypt +
              session multiplex   Host=script.…      no plaintext      net.Dial
```

Key invariants:

- **Authentication = AES-GCM tag.** No shared password, no certificates. Frames that fail `Open()` are dropped silently.
- **Apps Script never sees plaintext.** The script is a ~30-line forwarder; the AES key lives only on your machine and the VPS.
- **DNS travels through the tunnel.** The SOCKS5 server uses a no-op resolver; use `socks5h://` so DNS is resolved at the exit, not locally.
- **Long-poll, full-duplex.** The VPS holds each request open for 8s waiting for downstream bytes; the client reposts as soon as it returns. Two HTTP exchanges in flight at once give a full-duplex pipe. Downstream frames are coalesced in a small (~25 ms) window so streaming workloads send fewer, larger HTTP responses.
- **Health-aware multi-deployment.** When `script_keys` lists more than one deployment, the client picks endpoints in round-robin and exponentially blacklists any that misbehave; one same-poll retry is attempted on a fresh deployment so transient failures don't drop traffic.

### Wire format

- **Frame** (plaintext, before AES-GCM): `session_id (16) || seq (u64 BE) || flags (u8) || target_len (u8) || target || payload_len (u32 BE) || payload`
- **Envelope** (AES-GCM): `nonce (12) || ciphertext+tag`. Per-frame nonce, empty AAD.
- **HTTP body**: `[u16 frame_count] [u32 frame_len][envelope] ...`, then base64-encoded so it survives Apps Script's `ContentService` text round-trip.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Log says `decode batch: ... base64 ...` | Apps Script returned an HTML page instead of an encrypted batch. Either the deployment in `script_keys` isn't live, or **Who has access** is not set to `Anyone`. Re-deploy (Deploy → **New deployment**) and update `script_keys` in `client_config.json`. |
| Log says `relay returned HTTP 404 via …` | Same root cause as above — the deployment ID in your config doesn't match a live `/exec`. Re-deploy and update the config. |
| Log says `relay returned HTTP 500 via …` | Apps Script can't reach `VPS_URL`. Check the server address in `Code.gs`, confirm the VPS is up, and confirm inbound TCP/8443 is open. `curl http://your.vps.ip:8443/healthz` should return 200. |
| Log says `relay request failed via …: timeout` | Fronted connection to Google is failing. Try a different `google_host` — any 216.239.x.120 served by Google works. |
| Browser hangs on every request | You're using `socks5://` instead of `socks5h://`. The non-`h` form resolves DNS locally and the proxy gets called with raw IPs. |
| `[exit] dial X: ... timeout` on the VPS server logs | The target host blocks datacenter IPs, or your VPS has no outbound connectivity for that port. |
| Cloudflare-protected sites show captchas | Expected. Your VPS's IP is on a datacenter ASN, which Cloudflare's bot scoring often flags. Not a tunnel bug. |
| YouTube buffers a lot at 1080p | Expected. The tunnel adds ~300-800ms per round trip due to Apps Script dispatch overhead. 480p is comfortable. Deploying multiple `script_keys` (see above) helps with sustained throughput. |
| One deployment hits quota mid-session | If `script_keys` has more than one entry, the client automatically blacklists the failing one for a few seconds and keeps going on the others. With only one entry, browsing stops until the quota resets (10:30 AM Iran time / midnight Pacific). |
| Mismatched AES keys (`tunnel_key`) | Symptom: client logs no errors but no traffic flows; VPS logs `dial ...` lines never appear. Confirm `tunnel_key` is byte-identical in both configs. |

## Security Tips

- **Never share `client_config.json` or `server_config.json`** — the AES key is in there and a leaked key means anyone can tunnel through your VPS.
- **Generate a fresh key with `scripts/gen-key.sh`** for every deployment. Don't reuse keys across hosts.
- **AES-GCM is the only authentication.** There's no password, no rate-limiting, no per-user accounting. Treat the key like a server-admin password.
- **Apps Script logs every `doPost` invocation** in Google's dashboard (count and duration only — Apps Script never sees plaintext).
- **Keep `socks_host` on the client at `127.0.0.1`** unless you specifically want LAN sharing.
- **Each Apps Script deployment is rate-limited to ~20,000 calls/day** on free Google accounts.
